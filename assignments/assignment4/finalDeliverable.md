## Product Vision

- **Product Vision Statement:** For middle and high school educators struggling with student truancy, Teacher App is a mobile and web-based attendance management system that simplifies tracking and instantly notifies parents of absences, unlike conventional systems that are manual and time-consuming. Our product offers real-time updates and a user-friendly interface, setting a new standard for attendance management in schools.

## Learning and Growth Journey

### Reflection

Reflect on your journey in learning software engineering through concrete scenarios:

1. **Team Collaboration Approach:**
   Describe how your team used tools like Slack and Trello to coordinate tasks. Share an example of how assigning tasks in Trello helped streamline your group projects and fostered effective communication.

   (Miled)- Trello helped me with remebering what I needed to do for the weekend. For example, if I wanted to to work on something over the weekend instead of texting the chat about what everyone did I can infer better and actually know what needs to be done, what already has been done, what is going to get done. Better flow to work more efficiently. 

3. **Challenges and Overcoming Them:**
   Recall a specific challenge, like debugging a code issue together. Explain how you collaborated to identify the bug's source and successfully resolved it. This experience showcases your problem-solving and teamwork skills.

   (Miled)- Throughout the semester I was thrown with many challenges, like the languages aspect. Even though we used the extensive library of Python, I to learn the strucutre of Tkinter, of how the classes and def correlate to each other. With Dash that was even more confusing because it was a mix of python and a bit HTML mixed into one. I defintetly learned that if there is will power to make a aspect of your task/project work then anyone can conquer any lanauge. 

5. **Accomplishments and Pride:**
   Highlight a feature you contributed to, such as creating a login system. Discuss how your combined skills enabled the team to deliver a functional feature that enhances user experience.

(Miled)- If we did not decide that my implementation would not work, I built this beautiful interface in Tkinter that took up most of the semseter. My most proud moment is how the functionaility of the project worked, everything worked so seamlessly and beautiful,  but we could not as team intergrate what I built. 

6. **Learning and Growth:**
   Provide an example of how you applied a concept learned in class to a practical scenario. Describe how you used version control (like Git) to collaborate on a coding assignment, improving code organization and collaboration.

## Product Showcase

### Elevator Pitch

Summarize your product's value proposition with relatable examples. For instance, explain how your app's streamlined user interface improves navigation for users, enhancing their overall experience.
(Miled)- Our app is streamlined the user interface and how seamlessly connects the user accounts automatically saves. As well as with a clean UI, teachers can navigate the software and easily understand the program.  

### Product Demo

Share simple examples of your product's functionality:

- **Example 1:** Demonstrate how users can browse product categories using a straightforward navigation bar.
- **Example 2:** Showcase how your cybersecurity-focused feature detects and alerts users about potentially harmful links.

(Miled)- Teachers can create a account, and then log in that account to make student list. With a toggle shift to indicit that the student is either in or out of the classroom. 
### Technical Architecture Overview

Simplify a technical concept with an example:

- **Example:** Explain the client-server architecture by comparing it to a waiter taking orders (client) and a kitchen preparing food (server).
  (Miled)- RESTful API waits for the waiters to come into the kitchen to prepare the food. Meaning the RESTful API is listening on the teacher feedback to create account and login into the account, in order to store them into the database (Mongodb)

### Codebase Exploration

Illustrate a coding concept with a relatable analogy:

- **Example:** Describe a conditional statement (like an "if" statement) as a recipe that's followed only if certain conditions, like having all ingredients, are met.

### Access Your Work

- **[Presentation Slides](link-to-presentation):** Share a link to your final presentation slides.
- **[Source Code Repository](link-to-repo):** Provide access to your source code repository.
- **Other Materials:** Include links to diagrams or documents you created for your project.

## Final Reflection Presentation

- **Duration:** 25-minute minimum, 40-minute maximum

## Career Readiness Assessment

Answer the following questions with practical examples:

1. **Team Collaboration Skills:** Reflect on a time when coordinating with team members improved a project's outcome or efficiency.

Emily - Getting together with the team a couple of times each week helped us to all stay on the same page and moving in the same direction.  The moments where we stopped communicating with each other during the semester were the moments that we had the most trouble.

2. **Problem-Solving Abilities:** Share a situation where you had to troubleshoot a technical issue and how you approached the problem-solving process.

Emily - When we had to decide which direction to go with our front end, we got in a meeting and I laid out all of the options that we had, and we all discussed which direction we wanted to go in.  There were several different sides to each option we had, and we were able to talk through them and decide on the option that was going to be the best in our circumstance.

3. **Contributions to the Project:** Discuss a specific task you contributed to and how your involvement positively impacted the project's development.

Emily - I was in charge of keeping the team on track and organized.  I took care of taking meeting notes at all of our meetings, making sure that we completed sprint reviews when they were needed (though I wasn't always successful), and submitting written assignments.  I also kept up with the assignments throughout the semester, making sure that they stayed updated when we made changes.  I also set up trello cards, however as the semester went on and we started talking more I was less diligent about keeping the board updated as we were all on the same page.

4. **Applied Knowledge:** Describe a technical concept learned in class that you've used in your project, highlighting its practical relevance.

Emily - We learned about using tools to help us stay organized, such as version control in Git and to-do lists in the Trello environment.  In learning these tools, I learned different ways of collaboration and the importance of being able to communicate clearly and concisely to let other team members know what I've been working on, whether it's version control in a document on Git or a to-do list item in Trello.

5. **Adaptability and Learning:** Provide an example of a challenge you faced that required learning a new skill or concept, and how you adapted to overcome it.

Emily - I was unfamiliar with many of the tools that we utilized in class, and the software development life cycle as a whole.  Throughout the semester, I had to learn about using Git and the different frameworks we were using in our project.  I did my best to look up articles and Youtube videos to help me undrstand the different things I was doing, and I also did my best to utilize the knowledge of my teammates in trying to learn these new systems.  When each of us found a good article or video, we shared it to the group so that we could all add to our understanding.
