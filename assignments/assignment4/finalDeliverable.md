## Learning and Growth Journey

### Reflection

Reflect on your journey in learning software engineering through concrete scenarios:

1. **Team Collaboration Approach:**
   Describe how your team used tools like Teams and Trello to coordinate tasks. Share an example of how assigning tasks in Trello helped streamline your group projects and fostered effective communication.

   Miled - Trello helped me with remebering what I needed to do for the weekend. For example, if I wanted to to work on something over the weekend instead of texting the chat about what everyone did I can infer better and actually know what needs to be done, what already has been done, what is going to get done. Better flow to work more efficiently. 

   Emily - We were able to utilize both Teams and Trello to keep each other organized and accountable.  While we didn't use Trello to the full extent that we could and should have, it provided an extra tool to help us track what needed to be done and by whom.  We also used teams to communicate with each other in order to have a better understanding of what each person was working on when we weren't diligent about updating Trello.  Teams also provided us with a platform to bounce ideas off of each other when we were working on a particular component, whether we were having trouble with the implementation or just unsure of what direction to go.

   David - Teams was a great tool to help communicate and organize our project. I used teams a lot to update my teammates on  the source code and the troubles I was facing. I definitely should've used Trello more to help organize myself and the tasks that I had to do for the project. Discord was also really useful for team meetings and communication. As a team, we had a great start and struggled a little at the end but we were still able to push through thanks to our strong communication.

  Mohammed -  Teams helped communicate and keep organized. It allowed everyone to be on the same page for the most part. Early into the semester, Trello was helpful but as time went on most of our communication was through Discord and teams. 


3. **Challenges and Overcoming Them:**
   Recall a specific challenge, like debugging a code issue together. Explain how you collaborated to identify the bug's source and successfully resolved it. This experience showcases your problem-solving and teamwork skills.

   Miled - Throughout the semester I was thrown with many challenges, like the language aspect. Even though we used the extensive library of Python, I had to learn the structure of Tkinter, of how the classes and functions correlate to each other. With Dash that was even more confusing because it was a mix of Python and a bit HTML mixed into one. I definitely learned that if there is will power to make an aspect of your task/project work then anyone can conquer any language. 

   Emily - We had several struggles with our choices in front end frameworks.  Though I worked mostly to help keep everyone organized and on task, I did my best to think outside of the box and suggest points where we could shift gears a little bit.  Throughout the process of finalizing our front end, we talked through what we were thinking and came up with a solution.

   Mohammed - The biggest challenge we went through was getting a front-end design for a web app that was compatible with our back end and database. We wanted to get a simple functionality with the back end, front end, and database to work before we moved on and started adding features such as push notifications. Initially, we had agreed to Django for the front end assuming it would pair nicely with a Django back end. Miled explored some other compatible front-end frameworks that were coded in Python because as a group we were trying to stick to Python for language. The framework he ended up going with was for desktop apps and was not easy for David to pair with the backend. We also tried using Dash which was recommended by AI to pair easily, but it utilizes Flask which gave us trouble as well. I realized that time was ticking and decided to do a simple HTML/CSS form with Javascript in case we would not be able to get Dash to work with our backend apps. This ended up being a lifeline for our project and what we used.

   David - The biggest challenge was honestly connecting the frontend part of the source code with our backend. Miled tried multiple routes to get a frontend going that would easily connect with our backend but unfortunately, they weren't as compatible as we thought. Trying to connect our frontend with our backend code took up most of the time during the project. If we had a little more time we most likely would've gotten a fully functioning app. Luckily Mohammed was able to help Miled out and quickly come up with an html and css forms that allowed for easy integration with our backend.


5. **Accomplishments and Pride:**
   Highlight a feature you contributed to, such as creating a login system. Discuss how your combined skills enabled the team to deliver a functional feature that enhances user experience.
   
   Miled - If we did not decide that my implementation would not work, I built this beautiful interface in Tkinter that took up most of the semester. My most proud moment is how the functionaility of the project worked, everything worked so seamlessly and beautiful,  but we could not as team intergrate what I built. 

   Emily - I, with the input of the team, worked to make sure that all of our deliverables were complete and submitted on time.  I also did my best to support the others as much as I could when they ran into roadblocks and researched ways to get things working together.

   Mohammed - Iâ€™m happy with how easily I was able to implement a database into MongoDB using excel. This also allowed me and David to have more time to focus on the issues with the libraries when trying to connect the database and back end. I am also proud of the HTML frontend I was able to create on short notice. This allowed us to be able to have a visual aspect to pair with the back end and database.

   David- I pride myself on learning a creating a backend system in Django for the first time. Although the functionality is simple, it's smooth and seamless and performs most of the functions we wanted it to do except for push notifications. Overall even with our struggles, we were still able to deliver a final deliverable with basic functionality.

7. **Learning and Growth:**
   Provide an example of how you applied a concept learned in class to a practical scenario. Describe how you used version control (like Git) to collaborate on a coding assignment, improving code organization and collaboration.

   Emily - We implemented the Agile development life cycle throughout the semester, and through that cycle we took an iterative approach to our program.  Due to some challenges faced toward the end of the semester we weren't able to implement all of the features that we were hoping to, but when taking an iterative approach you are still left with a complete program, even if it doesn't have all of the functionality that we were hoping for.  

   Utilizing Git allowed us to all have access to the code that everyone was working on.  As Miled was working on the Dash front end, he found that it needed a very specific directory set up to run, so he was able to upload it to Git the way it needed to be set up so that we could each run and test the code.  It also allowed us to be able to see the progress that we were all making between meetings instead of being limited to checking in when we were together.

## Product Showcase

### Elevator Pitch

Summarize your product's value proposition with relatable examples. For instance, explain how your app's streamlined user interface improves navigation for users, enhancing their overall experience.

Hate overcomplicated attendance tracking systems?  Are you annoyed by digging through a bunch of pages to find the right class?  Teacher.io provides a simple user interface that displays the names of your students all in one place, with a switch next to their name that allows you to mark them as absent or present with a single click.  Say goodbye to lost pages and complicated systems and get Teacher.io today!

### Product Demo

Share simple examples of your product's functionality:

- **Example 1:** Teachers can create or log in to their account and create their list of students.
- **Example 2:** With a toggle shift, teachers can indicate that a student is present or absent from the classroom.
- **Example 3:** The user's profiles are saved to the Database

### Technical Architecture Overview

Simplify a technical concept with an example:

- **Example:** Explain the client-server architecture by comparing it to a waiter taking orders (client) and a kitchen preparing food (server).
  The RESTful API is listening for the teacher feedback (client placing an order) to create an account and login into the account, in order to send the information into the database (MongoDB), like a waiter submitting a food order to the chef.  The requested information (food) is then returned to the teacher (client).

### Codebase Exploration

Illustrate a coding concept with a relatable analogy:

- **Example:** Creating a program is like making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Each component, the bread, the peanut butter, and the jelly all need to be made separately and then put together.  In a program, you need to create a front end, a backend with an API, and in our case, a database.  Each of these components was set up with different frameworks, and once we had each working, we were able to tie them all together like a delicious peanut butter and jelly trifecta.

## Career Readiness Assessment

Answer the following questions with practical examples:

1. **Team Collaboration Skills:** Reflect on a time when coordinating with team members improved a project's outcome or efficiency.

Emily - Getting together with the team a couple of times each week helped us all stay on the same page and move in the same direction.  The moments when we stopped communicating with each other during the semester were the moments that we had the most trouble. 

Miled- Picking a time at the beginning of the semester was a genius move. Meaning we all had to stick with the schedule that chose for ourselves. Most of our teammates stay on top of that schedule. 

David - Getting together with Mo after a class one day we sat and he helped me to download MongoDB on my system. Without his help, I would not have been able to get the backend to integrate smoothly with our database.


2. **Problem-Solving Abilities:** Share a situation where you had to troubleshoot a technical issue and how you approached the problem-solving process.

Emily - When we had to decide which direction to go with our front end, we got in a meeting and I laid out all of the options that we had, and we all discussed which direction we wanted to go in.  There were several different sides to each option we had, and we were able to talk through them and decide on the option that was going to be the best in our circumstances. 

Miled- Telling my team throughout the semester about the functionality of the code, within minutes of each meeting updating to its full functionality. 

David - Login functionality of our code. For some reason when we would log in with an existing user, an error would occur that stated that the objects in our database have no primary key. With the use of AI, I explained the error message and when it would occur. I found out that MongoDB has a function where it autogenerates primary keys for each piece of data that is created. The problem that was causing the error message was that I had defined the primary key in the models file for the accounts app. I edited the models and commented out the primary key definition. Even when I did that I still had the same error occur so what I did next was clear the data for accounts. Once I cleared all the accounts in our database and added them back in with the changes I made to models, log-in was functioning correctly.

3. **Contributions to the Project:** Discuss a specific task you contributed to and how your involvement positively impacted the project's development.

Emily - I was in charge of keeping the team on track and organized.  I took care of taking meeting notes at all of our meetings, making sure that we completed sprint reviews when they were needed (though I wasn't always successful), and submitting written assignments.  I also kept up with the assignments throughout the semester, making sure that they stayed updated when we made changes.  I also set up Trello cards, however as the semester went on and we started talking more I was less diligent about keeping the board updated as we were all on the same page.

Miled- I contributed to the project of having a frontend in Tkinter. This frontend within our presentation was our stepping stone into the project. When Mohammed had to build the HTML frontend rapidly having the Tkinter Frontend already being there built as a good template really helped getting the frontend built in HTML. 

David - I was tasked with creating the backend system of our project and connecting everything for smooth and seamless functionality. Creating the backend was fun and was the backbone of the project. It allowed for seamless functionality in the project.

4. **Applied Knowledge:** Describe a technical concept learned in class that you've used in your project, highlighting its practical relevance.

Emily - We learned about using tools to help us stay organized, such as version control in Git and to-do lists in the Trello environment.  In learning these tools, I learned different ways of collaboration and the importance of being able to communicate clearly and concisely to let other team members know what I've been working on, whether it's version control in a document on Git or a to-do list item in Trello. 

David - Big shoutout to my Intro to Databases class I took last semester. It gave me a basic understanding of databases and database models. So creating models for the database wasn't too difficult which allowed for an easy setup of our project database.

5. **Adaptability and Learning:** Provide an example of a challenge you faced that required learning a new skill or concept, and how you adapted to overcome it.

Emily - I was unfamiliar with many of the tools that we utilized in class, and the software development life cycle as a whole.  Throughout the semester, I had to learn about using Git and the different frameworks we were using in our project.  I did my best to look up articles and YouTube videos to help me understand the different things I was doing, and I also did my best to utilize the knowledge of my teammates in trying to learn these new systems.  When each of us found a good article or video, we shared it to the group so that we could all add to our understanding.

David - I was very unfamiliar with Django and backend work since I don't have much experience with both. Throughout the semester watching YouTube videos, and reading up on Django documentation and StackOverflow were great resources that helped me to grasp a better understanding. I now have a better understanding of how Django works and is structured. I have the confidence to be able to look at a Django project and have a grasp on how it works.

Miled- Dash I had to learn with a new software within a week, with Dash being a mix between of HTML and python functions made it very difficult.
