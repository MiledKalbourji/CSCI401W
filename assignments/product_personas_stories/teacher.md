## Product Definition

Empowering educators and enhancing student engagement, Teacher App envisions a future where bunking and truancy is reduced in middle schools and high schools. By providing a user friendly application for teachers to manage attendance and send push notifications our goal is to improve student success and well being. Teacher App strives to be the go-to solution, changing how teachers approach attendance tracking, ultimately shaping a positive educational experience for both educators and students alike.

## Vision Statement

For middle and high school educators struggling with student truancy, Teacher App is a mobile and web-based attendance management system that simplifies tracking and instantly notifies parents of absences, unlike conventional systems that are manual and time-consuming. Our product offers real-time updates and a user-friendly interface, setting a new standard for attendance management in schools.

## Product Personas

## Product Scenarios

### Product Scenario 1

**Jane Doe ** works in the Gotham City School District, which is home to a diverse group of students coming from many different situations.  The student truancy rates have been on the rise over the past several years, and it's her job to find a solution to this problem. Due to their poor performance in this area the district is at risk of losing significant funding, putting many of their programs at risk.  Jane stumbled across Teacher App in her research and sees it as an innovative solution to tracking student truancy and involving parents as part of the solution.  She is excited to implement the new app into the district and is hopeful that truancy rates will begin to decline.

**Vinny Ucci**, A math teacher at Gotham High School has a reoccurring issue with a student named Elis in his period 3 class who refuses to show up to his class and continues to make up excuses as to why they are late or never there. This student in Mr Ucci's class only shows up at most once a week. Mr. Ucci has tried relaying the information to the parents via email and phone calls and has had no success. By using teacher.io Elis's parents/guardians will be notified via text message every time Elis bunks class. Thanks to teacher.io Elis's parents now know that he has been bunking class and will be failing math if he doesn't change.


**Elis Jones** is a 15 year old Sophomore at Gotham High School. He is the child of a single mother Eliza Jones. His mother works double shifts throughout the week so she is not able to be as active in Elis's education as he would like. On average Elis misses 11 of the 30 class periods scheduled per week. His mother is not even in the know about this situation. By using teacher.io Elis’ mother will be notified as to when he is missing class so she can take action with her son. Elis has been taking advantage of the freedom afforded by his mother’s work schedule. 

**Eliza Jones** - Single Parent 35 years old has a child named Elis Jones Eliza has long days working the emergency room, working almost 16 hours days.   Her eldest son Elis just started high school. Within the first month, Eliza had realized that her son Elis has been hanging out with a different group of friends from the previous year. Elis has started to become more distant from his mother and would not be in tune for conversations when he had with Elis. Eliza realized that she needed to know what was going on. The following day Eliza signed up on teacher.io, within the school district to have notifications whenever Elis skipped class. Within the first week Eliza had realized that Eliz had been skipping the last period of class and catching a ride from his new group of friends, before Eliza got home from her 16 hour work day. Thanks to teacher.io Eliza can freely roam her day knowing that Elis is safe in school and learning.
