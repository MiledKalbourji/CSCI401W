The inception of our project was marked by deliberations on potential areas of interest and recognizing our strengths within the domain of computer science. The decision was made in favor of devising a blockchain forensic analysis tool. This tool would assist financial establishments in probing into their clientâ€™s financial transactions, particularly the source and transfer of funds. Given the burgeoning popularity of the crypto market and the attendant potential for financial crime, the significance of transaction risk identification cannot be overstated.
