3. **Lesson 3**: Try to have everyone working on the same system, downloading the same libraries from the same sources to eliminate conflicting versions.

5. **Lesson 5**: Thinking about developing this project from the ground up was overwhelming at first, but with frameworks and similar projects available it seems much more manageable.
