### üí° **Lessons Learned**:

*(Reflect on the process, decisions made, tools used, and the challenges encountered. Discuss any insights that the team can take forward into the next sprint.)*

1. **Lesson 1**:   Lesson learned is always use different tools, and have them at your disposal. Next time instead of researching just one of the tools at a time, research mutliple tools at a time.  At First I thought about using Kivy, another powerful Python interface, that is great for mobile applications. After a very few crucial days trying to install Kivy, my problems could not go away. I used Tkinter and got away with the GUI with proper fucntionality.

2. **Lesson 2**: Look for different perspectives and ask for alternate opinions when facing a frustrating error.
   
3. **Lesson 3**: Look at documentation for the tools that you're using.

4. **Lesson 4**: Create documentation for code so that others can understand what is going on in the code.

5. **Lesson 5**: Set aside time for this class every week to give ample time to work.

### üåü **Wins**:

*(Celebrate your successes! List major or minor accomplishments, breakthroughs, or moments of clarity.)*

1. **Win 1**: Miled's win is with the GUI. Getting the functionality of toggle shift button to work.  Then having the team to celebrate the success was the stepping stone to motivate us to drive this project to its final stages.

2. **Win 2**: We have almost created all of the functionalities that we set out to create.  All that's left is to get everything connected and send text notifications.

3. **Win 3**: Successfully creating and running the API.

### üîÑ **Areas for Improvement**:

*(Identify areas where the team can make changes to be more efficient, effective, or collaborative in the next sprint.)*

1. **Improvement 1**: Miled suggested that he could have better communication with the team on the days he is free. To meet for the implementation of both, the back end and database because I have solely worked on the frontend (GUI). As a result of me not being present at the meetings hinders the communication between my team and I, because I have a very cruical componet of the App, my team cannot move forward.  

2. **Improvement 2**: Add documentation to code.
