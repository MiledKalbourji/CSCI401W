### 💡 **Lessons Learned**:

*(Reflect on the process, decisions made, tools used, and the challenges encountered. Discuss any insights that the team can take forward into the next sprint.)*

1. **Lesson 1**:   Lesson learned is always use different tools, and have them at your disposal. Next time instead of researching just one of the tools at a time, research mutliple tools at a time.  At First I thought about using Kivy, another powerful Python interface, that is great for mobile applications. After a very few crucial days trying to install Kivy, my problems could not go away. I used Tkinter and got away with the GUI with proper fucntionality.

### 🔄 **Areas for Improvement**:

*(Identify areas where the team can make changes to be more efficient, effective, or collaborative in the next sprint.)*

1. **Improvement 1**: (miled): I could have better communication with my team on the days I am free. To meet for the implemenation of both, the back end and database because I have soley worked on the frontend (GUI). As a result me not being present to the meetings as hendor the communication between my team and I, because I have a very cruical componet of the App, my team cannot move forward.
