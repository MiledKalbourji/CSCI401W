### 🗒️ **Notes**:

- Reviewed assignment 2 and identified what is left to complete
- Miled presented his findings on alternatives to our app.  Others include hall passes and other advanced features in their systems.
- While these other systems have a lot of features, ours offers specialization in student truancy tracking that others don't have.
- More features can be added to our system, but our target goal is truancy so that is the focus of our app.
- We need to circle back to FERPA and security, it is tricky to implement.
- Written agreements, adopt physical and technical measures, ensure that only authorized personnel can access
- In any analysis of the data, we must remove any personal identifying information about the students.
- There are a lot of different metrics that can be looked for across the data
- Reviewed tools for creating diagrams
- Reviewed feedback on Assignment 1 to ensure we had covered all bases.
- Checked in on Trello
