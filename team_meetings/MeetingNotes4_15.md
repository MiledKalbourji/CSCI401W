### **To-Dos**:

1. 

### 🗒️ **Notes**:

- Tkinter doesn't support web applications, which is what we are trying to develop, so we need to redirect to a different front end framework.
- The Tkinter code is in python, so we should be able to transfer the code to a new framework relatively easily.
- Python possibilities: Anvil, Dash, Bulky, Brython (not ideal), Transcript (confusing).
- David was thinking just do basic HTML/CSS front end.
- Emily suggested that we give a python framework a shot in an attempt to transfer the code that we have, but is willing to fall back on a simple HTML/CSS framework.
- We will try Dash tomorrow and see how it goes.  Miled used AI to start converting the code that he had into code that is compatible with Dash.
- Emily will get Dash installed and work on getting Miled's code converted/set up in Dash on Tuesday.  David and Miled said they would be available if help is needed.
- David will show the backend code at some point so that we all have a good understanding of the code.
