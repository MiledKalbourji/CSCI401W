### 🗒️ **Notes**:

- Mo and David got the login database working yesterday
- Mo worked on some HTML stuff as a backup for the dash stuff
- We are running up against a time crunch - if the dash implementation isn't going to work we need to have a backup plan
- We can either connect via tkinter as a desktop app, we can get dash working, or we can set up an html page
- Miled and David in their initial attempt had set up a front end html page so we may have additional functionality ready to go.
- Mo showed us what he had whipped up quickly yesterday
- Miled is going to look at his github to see if he still has what he had worked on previously
- Add edit, save, and delete functions to the student page that Mo created
- We are going to switch to the HTML page, either the one that Miled got created or the one that Mo made yesterday.
- Mo's going to add some functions tonight and get the code uploaded, and Miled is going to add some styling.
- We'll get the code wrapped up on Monday, and record our video during our meeting next Thursday.
