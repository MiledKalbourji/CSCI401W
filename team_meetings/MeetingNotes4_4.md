- David and Mo got together and created a database to match the schema
- Ask on Monday about if we need to make a new database for accounts to go with second app created for login or if we can use the same database.
- Emily will look into how to get everything connected as she's been feeling like she hasn't been pulling her weight.
- Once we get everything connected, we can focus on getting text notification functionality set up.  Beyond that, we can implement additional security features.
